            encourage to attempt
            to complete the set exercises before your

            have time to discuss any issues that arise

            <strong>Assignments: Parts 1, 2 and 3:</strong>
            are incremental instalments of a web site
            development task. In Part 1 you will
            demonstrate your ability to develop
            and deploy on a server well-structured,
            linked Web pages with text, graphics, tables 
            and forms, styled with CSS. Part 2 further
            extends the use of HTML elements and makes use 
            of JavaScript to validate forms and
            add dynamic behaviour to the Web page. In
            Part 3 you will use forms to
            submit and retrieve data from a server using
            PHP and MySQL.
