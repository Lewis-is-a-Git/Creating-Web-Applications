javascript errors
  event links dont have brackets

php is used to make templates of the html data
  just include the php script to getHeader();

php is server side scripting, processes the script and sends it to the client
  embedded scripting language
  supports many databases (mySQL)
  scripts in html files must be .php filetype
  
echo
  needs double quotation marks
  listing multiple string, or concatenation
  
constants
  define("PI", 3.14);
  no dollar sign
  can only be defined as global
  
array
  $days = array("mon", "tues");
  or
  $days = ["mon", "tues"];
  
  
global variables work differently
  need to declare 
  global $x, $y
  to use in a function

loop
  foreach (array as element){
  }

  example
    echo "<ul>" ;
    foreach ($daysOfWeek as $day) {
      echo "<li>$day</li>";
    }
    echo "</ul>";
    
    
Differences between Javascript
  $ for var
  global to access global variables
  constant doesnt need $, not declared inside function
  double quotations process varaibles
