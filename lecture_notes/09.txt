php bug solving
  fiunctions need keywords
  contants dont need $ symbol
  global variables need global keyword
  
  
Superglobal
  get or post
  $_GET or $_POST all uppercase
  auto populated associative array (key value pairs)
  
  
regular expresstion match
  preg_match("//", $string)
  
common regular epxressions are provided by php
  filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)
  this filter is pre defined
  
php includes
  <?php
    include_once("php_menu.php"); //rest of content will load
  ?>
  require("php_menu.inc");
    critical error on failure
      wont be able to see anyhtign else
use include for non essential html elements (nav bar)
use require for database connection parameters

.inc extenstion is used for php include files
  
active page on header
  in php incliude tag
  add new variable $page = title
  insert php into the anchor tag <?php echo ($page =="jobspage")?"class='active'":""; ?>
  set that link to active class on each link
  
  
Managing state
  remeber user details and provide reccomendations
  passing variables to other pages
    a href page.php?variable=$variable
  pass data from page to page to page (not so convenient)
  
  session is used to pass data betweeen many pages
  text file saved server side
  cookies
  superglobal $_SESSION
  
  
  delete session (log out)
  session_start(); //finds session
  $_SESSION = array(); //clears variable
  session_destroy(); //removes the txt file from the server
  
  if isset _get
  
  if isset _session
